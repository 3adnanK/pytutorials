      <description>Before starting the pytutorials series i want to explain what is PyTutorials. PyTutorials is a beginner guide to learn the basics of python and programming, each tutorial will contain an explanation on the topic followed by 2 or 3 exercices to practice what you have learned. Two tutorials will be posted every week. In this tutorial we will be using python 3. I am assuming that you already have python installed on your machine if not you can download it from here or you can use an online interpreter for python.</description>
