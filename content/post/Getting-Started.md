Before starting the pytutorials series i want to explain what is PyTutorials.<br/>
PyTutorials is a beginner guide to learn the basics of python and programming,
each tutorial will contain an explanation on the topic followed 
by 2 or 3 exercices to practice what you have learned.<br/>
Two tutorials will be posted each week.<br/>
In this tutorial we will be using python 3.<br/>
I am assuming that you already have python installed on your machine
if not you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/) or you can use an online interpreter for python [here](http://www.repl.it/languages/python3).
